# Data-Mining-Student-Dropout

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the creation and evaluation of two machine learning models, **Logistic Regression** and **Neural Network**, to predict student dropout based on various features in the dataset. The goal is to identify factors that influence student dropout rates and to classify students as likely to drop out or stay.

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Import and clean the student dropout dataset.
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, handle unbalanced data

2. **Model 1: Logistic Regression**  
   - Train a logistic regression model to predict student dropout.
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. **Model 2: Neural Network**  
   - Build a neural network model
   - Evaluate the model's performance.
